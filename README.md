Streaming and Compression Algorithms


Codecs are algorithms that are used to compress and decompress digital audio and video data. They allow for the efficient storage and transmission of media files, as well as for their playback on various devices.

There are many different codecs available, each with its own specific set of features and characteristics. Some codecs are designed for high-quality audio and video, while others are optimized for low file sizes and fast transmission.

In the context of streaming, codecs are used to encode the audio and video data before it is transmitted over the internet. The encoded data is then decoded by the media player on the viewer's device, allowing the media to be played back.

There are many different codecs that are commonly used for streaming, including H.264, HEVC, VP9, and AV1. Each codec has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of codec can have a significant impact on the quality and performance of the streaming experience.

In addition to audio and video codecs, there are also codecs for other types of data, such as image and text codecs. These codecs are used to compress and decompress data for a variety of applications, including web and mobile development, data storage, and data transmission.
